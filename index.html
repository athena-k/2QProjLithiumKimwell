			  <div>Genshin Impact has been quite a popular game for the past year. It's an open-world game, focused
			  on action and adventure. But what about the food?
			  <br><br><span>While there are enemies and various structures in this fictional world, there are also many
			  key resources to be found. There are precious stones, loot chests, and most importantly, food ingredients!
			  We can hunt boars, birds and fish for meat, and use plants like berries and flowers as well. We can even
			  buy ingredients like tofu and rice from shopkeepers in different nations! These are then carefully cooked 
			  to have different effects, not to mention that they look delicious and so very aesthetically pleasing! There
			  was even a recent event all about cooking, so I'd like to talk a little more about the food!</span></div>

			  <br><br><span>There are common foods, expensive foods, and foods that can only be made from local specialties
			  from the three currently released regions. While we can't physically experience eating them outselves, it would 
			  still be nice to appreciate them better, since a lot of players are more invested in the lore, the characters, 
			  and sacrificing their life's savings to the gacha system. :)</span>

			  categories depending on their characteristics. Here are the basics!</span></div>
			
			  <div><a href="htdocs/innerpage-mondstadt.html">Mondstadt</a>
			  <br><span>This region, inspired by Germany, is the City of the Wind. As such, their dishes reflect the

			  <div><a href="htdocs/innerpage-liyue.html">Liyue</a>
			  <br><span>This China-inspired land is the most commerically successful nation of the seven. Their dishes
			  are mostly sophisticated and reflect their ideals clearly.</span></div>
				
			  <div><a href="htdocs/innerpage-inazuma.html">Inazuma</a>
			  <br><span>Based on real-life Japan, this region strives for eternity. Its dishes clearly showcase the culture
