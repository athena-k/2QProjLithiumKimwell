			  <h1>Liyue's spicy and savory dishes are directly inspired by the game's home country, China!</h1>

			  <div>What's unique about it?
			  <br><span>There are 43 local dishes, which is the most of all the released regions so far. This is understandable; since the game company is from China, it makes
			  sense that they would give the most emphasis to sharing their own culture, food included. In this collection, there are a lot of noodles, soups, tofu and rice
			  products, which is what we usually associate with Chinese food. They also emphasized their love of spice, with 9 of their recipes needing chilis.
			  This region is also the only one with event-exclusive dishes; certain food items could only be purchased during the Lantern Rite event, 
			  which is equivalent to Chinese New Year celebration. Jueyun Guoba (guoba is a type of Chinese scorched rice), Tianshu Meat, and Zhongyuan Chop Suey are
			  some appropriately named Liyue cuisine.

			  <div>Local Specialties
			  <br><span>Liyue, like Mondstadt, has 8 local specialties, 3 of which can be cooked. These are the Jueyun Chili, Violetgrass, and Qingxin. The 
			  chilis obviously add spice to the dishes, since simply smelling it makes one thirsty. The Violetgrass has a preserved fragrance and a strong vitality,
			  and the Qingxin grow at the mountaintops, so these three materials certainly add something unique to Liyuean food.

			  <div>Characters
			  <br><span>Like in Mond, Liyue characters have their own signature dishes, with their own stories behind them. An example is Zhongli's 
			  Slow-Cooked Bamboo Shoot Soup, derived from the regular Liyue dish, Bamboo Shoot Soup. Its high quality ingredients, meticulous preparation
			  and "particular" taste reflect the chef's vast knowledge and his respect for traditional techniques.
			  <br><br>There are chefs with cooking talents in Liyue as well; Xinyan can double defense dishes, Yun Jin can double adventure dishes, and Hu Tao can double 
			  any dish, as long as it's not cooked properly (relating to her dark-humor personality). But the most notorious is Xiangling, whose entire character
			  is based off cooking. She's a talented chef who's a bit too creative; she tries to cook everything, even the most unconventional items, such as 
			  slimes. Other notable NPCs are Chef Mao, Xiangling's father and owner of the Wanmin Restaurant, and Chef Yanxiao, who cooks at Wangshu Inn and also
			  entered a cooking contest against Xiangling.
