			  <h1>With more than 100 total food items, there's quite a lot to admire.</h1>
			  <figure><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Food"><img class="part1-pic" src="../images/food!.JPG" alt=""></a></figure>
			  <div>But why exactly did I choose to talk about this?
			  <br><span>Cooking mechanics in games are nothing new, but I really appreciate it when the process
			  is true to real life while not losing its integration into the game's fictional rules. In Genshin 
			  Impact, players can receive or buy recipes for dishes with magical properties, and it takes practice 
			  for the main character to grow proficient at it, which is how it is IRL; it's hard to perfect something
			  immediately. Another example is that characters actually get full from eating, and heavier dishes like 
			  soups fill them more than lighter dishes like apples or fried eggs. 
			  <br><br>Some characters also have different levels of cooking expertise, which is nice and gives them more uniqueness. 
			  They also have favorite dishes and least favorite dishes which fit with their personalities, and they can also 
			  add their own personal touch to certain special dishes. There are cultural aspects too, which would be touched upon 
			  in the pages for the other regions. Though I won't talk about them now, here's some more quick infodumping about 
			  the most important details by yours truly! ;)

			  <div>Quality
			  <br><span>Like in real life, not every dish is cooked perfectly, and it takes time to get better
			  at cooking it. In-game, if the cooking timing is messed up, the food would become a Suspicious 
			  Dish, which just looks blander, unappealing and has decreased effects. On the other hand, if the timing is
			  just right on, one would get a Delicious Dish, which looks really tasty with all its brightness and sparkles, and 
			  has increased effects. In the middle of the spectrum are the Regular Dishes, which are also the easiest to make.

			  <div>Complexities
			  <br><span>Most items in the game are rated by "stars", where more stars signify higher quality.
			  Food is no exception, and with higher quality comes higher complexity and difficulty. 1-star foods need maybe 
			  1 or 2 ingredients in total, and the player only needs to cook 5 Delicious Dishes to fully master the recipe
			  and cook them almost automatically. Meanwhile, 4 and 5-star foods need up to 4 different ingredients, and need
			  20 or 25 Delicious outputs in order to be mastered. Still, even cooking one Delicious Dish is a bit challenging. 
			  <br><br>Like mentioned before, higher quality foods have better effects, and their designs get
			  better too! We start off simple, with foods like Egg Rolls or Mint Jellies. The 2-stars get better with pancakes 
			  and pasta, and the 3-star dishes and above look absolutely appetizing! My favorites are at the right! ->

			  <div>Food Buffs
			  <br><span>Basically, these are the special effects, well-described by the icons on the left. Inspired by the game's wiki page,
			  all food items could be classified into four main groups, namely:
			  <ol>
				<li>Offensive Group - boosts Attack, Physical Damage, and Critical Hit Rate/Damage
				<li>Defensive Group - boosts Defense and Shield Strength
				<li>Stamina Group - restores Stamina and reduces Stamina Consumption for activities like 
				climbing or sprinting
				<li>Recovery Group - revives fallen characters and heals damaged characters (over a period 
				of time, or all at once)
			  </ol>
			  There are other effects, like managing temperature in cold environments. But while this is the
			  main use of food in Genshin, it's worth noting that these are based on real dishes and can be 
			  recreated if one has substitute ingredients, even if they'll never give us these magical boosts.
