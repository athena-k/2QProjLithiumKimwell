			  <div>What's unique about it?
			  <br><span>There are 33 local dishes. Like Liyue, a lot of its dishes (around a third of them) include rice in the recipe. There's a lot of seafood 
			  used too, such as shrimps, fish, and unagi (Japanese eels), which is a reference to the vast seas separating the region's islands; they must surely
			  use their natural oceans as another food source! Onigiri, Tonkotsu Ramen, and Sakura Tempura are some typical Inazuma dishes!

			  <div>Local Specialties
			  <br><span>Inazuma actually has 9 local specialties, but only 1 can be used as an ingredient. This is the Sakura Bloom, a petal fallen from the
			  grand shrine's sacred sakura. It adds a distinctly pink color to its dishes, making them look more aesthetically pleasing.

			  <div>Characters
			  <br><span>Like in the previous regions, Inazuman playable characters also have their Specialty Dishes. A good example is Kamisato Ayaka, whose 
			  specialty dish is "Snow on the Hearth", derived from the Inazuman dish, Sakura Mochi. Unlike most others, we actually know the reason why in-story;
			  when we go to a festival with her, she likes the mochi and asks for the recipe, wanting to try making it herself.
			  <br><br>So far, only one Inazuman character, Raiden, has notable cooking skills, but for a different reason. She's the only character so far who can't cook
			  at all! Moving on from that, some well-known NPC cooks in Inazuma are Kiminami Anna (who works at Kiminami Restaurant), and Shimura Kanbei (who owns Shimura's).
			  There's also a quest in Inazuma about a group of people (literally called Gourmet Supremos) who are working to find an ultimate recipe.

			  <div>Real Life Reimaginations!
			  <br><span>For Inazuma, I chose a different creator, though the dishes are still as appealing! Here are some dishes by
			  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4laAUUbcZ8"> MoriKitchen on YouTube (as seen below)</a>, with the
