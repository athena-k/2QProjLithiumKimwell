			  <h1>This nation is a land of wine and wind, and its food takes inspiration from European cuisines!</h1>

			  <div>What's unique about it?
			  <br><span>Despite being the first region we enter, there are only 27 local dishes, which is the fewest among all the regions so far. A lot of them use
			  bread, meat and potatoes as ingredients, which is a staple of European cuisine. This region is the only place where you can buy drinks from bars (non-alcoholic, 
			  of course), which is fitting, since wine is a major industry here. The names of the dishes also use some distinctly European terms; for example,
			  Flaming Red Bolognese, Sauteed Matsutake, and Sunshine Sprat.

			  <div>Local Specialties
			  <br><span>Mondstadt has 8 local specialties, 2 of which can be used for cooking. These two are Small Lamp Grass and Calla Lily. The lamp grass 
			  glow in the dark and are said to enhance flavors. Meanwhile, the lilies' petals are chunky when cooked, yet are sweet and a little bitter, and
			  have medicinal properties.

			  <div>Characters
			  <br><span>Playable characters can make their own specialty dishes, though it's not necessarily their favorite. This upgrades the effects,
			  changes the designs a bit, and adds a personal touch in its description. They usually upgrade local dishes; for example, Eula Lawrence's 
			  specialty dish is her Stormcrest Pie, derived from the Mondstadt local dish, Moon Pie.
			  <br><br>Some characters have more notorious cooking skills than others. Diona, Jean, and her sister Barbara can double healing dishes.
			  Noelle, a maid who can do anything, can double defense dishes. Some NPCs are also well known cooks; Brook is from a town of hunters and 
			  once participated in a cooking showdown. Sara, who mans a restaurant called Good Hunter, also sells ingredients, recipes, and food dishes in her shop.
